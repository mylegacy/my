ioctl VT_GETSTATE: Invalid argument (not a linux console?)

ioctl VT_GETSTATE: Invalid argument (not a linux console?)


The problem was that i was typing those commands in terminal 
and they must be typed in /dev/tty1/2/3...
using CTTRL + ALT +F1/F2/F3.





don't ask why, but this is what I am looking to accomplish:

through a logged in SSH terminal, I want to be able to open an image in the console (runlevel 3) of tty1 (tty1 can be logged in or not, doesn't matter)

I have fbi installed for the console image rendering, but I am willing to change that if need be.

Is this possible?

running ubuntu server 10.04 no xwindow system.

edit:

I should mention that simply redirecting the output of fbi did not work for me

fbi /pics/picture1 > /dev/tty1
